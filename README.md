## Anomaly Segmentation Project | Michael Di Giorgio (s317819) - Ethan Morleo (s317821) - Guillem Abello Domenech (s321071)

In this repository ypu will find the code used for the anomaly segmentation project (Project 4) for the Advanced Machine Learning course, submitted for the 06/02/2024 exam date.

# Baselines

In the eval folder you will find the code for using several criteria for anomaly segmentation (MSP - MaxLogit - MaxEntropy) for the baselines inferences and temperature scaling. [evalAnomaly.py](eval/evalAnomaly.py)

# Void Classifier

In the eval folder you will find the code used for the void classifier inferences. [evalVoidClassifier.py](eval/evalVoidClassifier.py)

# Project Extension - New Loss Funcitons

In the training folder you will find the code for using new loss functions (Jaccard, Logit Norm and Focal). [main.py](train/main.py)

# Colab

In the [Project_AML.ipynb](Project_AML.ipynb) file you will find the code we used in the Colab environment to run the script seen before.
